### Basic Idea

The Basic Idea of our projekt is the normal _Dining Philosophers Problem_ concept.

### My Idea

```
Starting point is a G5 summit with five presidents who have their own plane at an airport.
However, there are only 5 Eurofighters that can take off and one president has to be accompanied by two Eurofighters.
So only two can fly at the same time.
```
